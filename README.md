# MinimumCompute

Two approaches to building a computer from first principles:

## nandCompute - Educational Path
Building from NAND gates up through a complete working computer.

## MyAssembly - Hardware Path  
Microcode-based design ready for Arduino/breadboard deployment.

**From NAND gates to 'Hello, World!'**
